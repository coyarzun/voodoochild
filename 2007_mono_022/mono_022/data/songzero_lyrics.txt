PLEASE STOP!
STOP HURTING ME
I'VE SUFFERED ENOUGH

DETENTE Y VETE
I'VE DONE WHAT'S MINE
I DID IT MY HALF
HOW MUCH HARDER?

PONTE SOBRE MI Y NO EN MI CONTRA
ACCEPT ME

I'M A LUCKY MAN
ALWAYS SAD, DESIRING BE BLESSED

I'M INCREASSING POWER

I'M TRYING TO LIVE 
AND SING, OH NO!
OH YEAH!
