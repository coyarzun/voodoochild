COME CLOSER AND SEE
SEE INTO THE TREES
FIND THE GIRL
WHILE YOU CAN
COME CLOSER AND SEE
SEE INTO THE DARK
JUST FOLLOW YOUR EYES
JUST FOLLOW YOUR EYES

I HEAR HER VOICE
CALLING MY NAME
THE SOUND IS DEEP
IN THE DARK
I HEAR HER VOICE
AND START TO RUN
INTO THE TREES
INTO THE TREES

INTO THE TREES

SUDDENLY I STOP
BUT I KNOW IT'S TOO LATE
I'M LOST IN A FOREST
ALL ALONE
THE GIRL WAS NEVER THERE
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME
I'M RUNNING TOWARDS NOTHING
AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AGAAAAIN, AND AGAIIIIN, AND AGAIN, AGAIN, AND AAAAAAAAGAIN, AND AGAIN, AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AGAAAAIN, AND AGAIIIIN, AND AGAIN, AGAIN, AND AAAAAAAAGAIN, AND AGAIIIIIIIN
